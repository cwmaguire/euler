Project Euler solutions

For now I'm just going to leave my rough solutions with rough
notes.

Anyone who's interested in Project Euler is probably interested in
figuring out the solutions for themselves unless it's homework.

Files ending in .erl are Erlang files. Compile and load them in an
erlang shall with `c(<filename>)` (no extension, e.g.
`c(euler5))` or `c("<filename>.erl")` (with double quotes, with .erl
extension, e.g. `c("euler7.erl")`).

I might do other languages later (maybe Haskell?) but for now it's just
Erlang.
